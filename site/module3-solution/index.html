      <h3>The Old Astronomer to His Pupil</h3>
      <p>
        Reach me down my Tycho Brahe, I would know him when we meet, When I
        share my later science, sitting humbly at his feet; He may know the law
        of all things, yet be ignorant of how We are working to completion,
        working on from then to now. Pray remember that I leave you all my
        theory complete, Lacking only certain data for your adding, as is meet,
        And remember men will scorn it, 'tis original and true, And the obloquy
        of newness may fall bitterly on you. But, my pupil, as my pupil you have
        learned the worth of scorn, You have laughed with me at pity, we have
        joyed to be forlorn, What for us are all distractions of men's
        fellowship and smiles; What for us the Goddess Pleasure with her
        meretricious smiles! You may tell that German College that their honor
        comes too late, But they must not waste repentance on the grizzly
        savant's fate. Though my soul may set in darkness, it will rise in
        perfect light; I have loved the stars too fondly to be fearful of the
        night.
